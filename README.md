As a business owner, I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company. So that I can organize and plan my business. To do that, you need 2 sql files to use for mysqlworkbenchapp, a package.json & lock.json to include 2 to 3 things like node modules folder with mysql and inquirer, and your server.js to log in automatically. This will get you to know how to add, view, and update with vscode and Mysqlworkbench. 2 sql files had their different ways for mysqlworkbench. One had a schema to create a database and tables, and the other had seeds with instruct to use db and then insert into tabls. Make sure they are in shape and in order.
